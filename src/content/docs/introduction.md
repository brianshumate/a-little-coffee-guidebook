Coffee is a beverage almost mysterious as its history.

As the stories go, an Ethiopian goat-herder observed his goats chowing down
on coffee berries way back in the ninth century. That, or a Sufi mystic
caught a bird doing the same approximately four centuries later.

No matter which story you believe, there's no doubt that humans have been
enjoying a beverage made from the red berries of the genus *Coffeea* for
hundreds of years. Ethiopians are definitely credited for being the first to
recognize the nice caffeine buzz coffee provides.

After that, coffee spread throughout the Arab world, into Europe, and beyond.
Nowadays, coffee is a popular beverage and commodity the world over, with
millions of tons sold each year. It is a choice drink for waking up, a
pick-me-up, and keep-me-up.

Coffee is a beverage of dreams and art and conversation; it's a nerd's
delight for being up and hacking all night, and the early morning angler
or night watchman's best friend.

This little guide is a personal journal collecting ideas and methods around my
own coffee centered routines. I am sharing them here in the hope that they
help you to enjoy a fine cup of coffee too.
