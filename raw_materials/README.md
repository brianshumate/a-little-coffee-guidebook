# Raw Materials

The coffee beans and water that you use to create great cups of coffee
must be the highest quality possible.

You should strive to get beans from a trusted source that offers the best
available *single origin* beans.

If you want the taste of your
coffee to represent one pure variety, make sure that the beans you use are all sourced from
one origin. Many off-the-shelf beans sold by chain coffee stores and supermarkets
consist of mixed beans from various sources.

When in doubt, ask.

## Roasted Coffee Beans

There are numerous sources of mediocre and downright awful roasted coffee
beans, but we don't want to use those whenever possible. Some of the better
roasters ship their beans around the globe. Here are some recommendations
in alphabetical order:

1. [Blue Bottle Coffee](http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/) has a fantastic
selection of roasts in their online store as well.
2. [Counter Culture Coffee](https://counterculturecoffee.com/store/subscriptions)
3. [Ritual Roasters](http://www.ritualroasters.com/) Join their coffee club
   for regularly shipped single origin varieties of expertly roasted beans.

*What do you do?*

Right now I'm using both locally roasted beens, and completely satisfied with occasional beans from Ritual Roasters.

## Green Coffee Beans

If you'd like to try roasting your own beans, there are also nice sources of
green coffee beans out there:

1. [DIY Coffee Roasting ](https://diycoffeeroasting.com/green-coffee-beans/)
   home of Mr. Green Beans, a Portland Oregon based specialty coffee retailer.
2. [Sweet Maria's](http://www.sweetmarias.com/)

Eventually updates to this guide will include a section on roasting your own
beans after I've had a chance to get my own gear and run through some of the
various do-it-yourself roasting processes.
