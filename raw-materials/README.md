# Raw Materials

Life is too short for crappy coffee.

The coffee beans and water that you use to create great cups of coffee
must be the highest quality that you can possibly obtain.

You should strive to get coffee beans from a trusted source that offers the
best available *single origin* beans. Ideally, those beans could be organic,
and also sustainably harvested and traded under the values established by
the [Fair Trade USA](http://fairtradeusa.org/about-fair-trade-usa/mission)
organization whenever possible.

If you want the taste of your coffee to represent one pure strain or variety,
make sure that the beans you use are all sourced from one location or
grower. Many off-the-shelf beans sold by chain coffee stores and supermarkets
consist of mixed beans from various sources throughout the world.

When in doubt, ask.

## Roasted Coffee Beans

There are numerous sources of mediocre and downright awful roasted coffee
beans, but we don't want to use those beans if we can avoid doing so.
Some of the better roasters ship their beans around the globe.
Here are some recommendations in alphabetical order:

1. [Blue Bottle Coffee](http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/) has a fantastic
selection of roasts in their online store as well.
2. [Counter Culture Coffee](https://counterculturecoffee.com/store/subscriptions)
3. [Ritual Roasters](http://www.ritualroasters.com/) Join their coffee club
   for regularly shipped single origin varieties of expertly roasted beans.

*What do you do?*

Right now I'm using both locally roasted beens, and completely satisfied with
beans from Ritual Roasters Coffee Club as well.

## Green Coffee Beans

If you'd like to try roasting your own beans, there are also nice sources of
green coffee beans out there:

1. [DIY Coffee Roasting ](https://diycoffeeroasting.com/green-coffee-beans/)
   home of Mr. Green Beans, a Portland Oregon based specialty coffee retailer.
2. [Sweet Maria's](http://www.sweetmarias.com/)

Eventually updates to this guide will include a section on roasting your own
beans after I've had a chance to get my own gear and run through some of the
various do-it-yourself roasting processes.

## Water

The other half of a magic cup of coffee is good clean water. Make sure that
you're using the purest water you can within reason and that it doesn't come
from any type of vessel that can impart additional flavors.

You can't go wrong with good clean glass.
