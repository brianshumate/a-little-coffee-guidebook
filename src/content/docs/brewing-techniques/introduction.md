## Tips

- Coffee beans taste best within 2 weeks of roasting time
- Always ensure your equipment is clean before brewing
- Use the cleanest water possible (see **Raw Materials** section)

## Coffee Amount and Grind

The amount of coffee to grind for the brewing methods discussed here can vary
and is a matter of personal preference and fine tuning process. A good
starting point for pour overs and pressing is approximately 32-37 grams of
beans to 500 grams (or so) of water.

Another way to put this, is to aim for something like a 1:10 to 1:14 ratio of
ground coffee to water.

## Water Temperature

Water temperature does affect overall brew quality and is a another variable
one can tune to their individual taste. A typical water temperature range
is between 175 degrees Fahrenheit and 200 degrees Fahrenheit.

Do not use water over 200 degrees or water that is boiling outright.

## Brewing Methods

Now we arrive at the fun part: **MAKING THE COFFEE**!

There are probably a dozen or more common ways to brew coffee. Some ways,
such as the French Press, Moka Pot, AeroPress, or Vietnamese coffee involve
their own specialized equipment.

The following sections cover methods which I prefer to use for brewing coffee.
Since I'm not limiting myself to the techniques covered here, this part of
the guide will expand later.
